# Free-Map-Pack-01
[UU] Free-Map-Pack-01

Here is a pack of maps for FoundryVTT to discover my creations.
All maps are made in 3D perspective and use 3D assets. Then the trees are added on a new layer, managed by the Levels module (by TheRipper93)

This pack contains:
- 1 forest map
- 1 meadow/plain map
- 1 swamp map
- 1 village merchant map
- 1 village tavern map

Feel free to try and use these maps however you like.

Dependencies:
- Levels (by TheRipper93) [Free]

Recommended modules to improve the final rendering (which are already configured for this pack):
- FXmaster (by Ghost & U~Man) [Free]
- Monk's Active Tile Triggers (by IronMonk) [Free]
- Simple Calendar (by Vigoren) [Free]
- SmallTime (by Unsoluble) [Free]
- LightSwitch (by TheRipper93) [Paid]
- Arms Reach
